## About Sugar Shack Recipes

This app was created as a forum for bakers to posts recipes to have them tried and rated to see if the recipe should be added to their line up of dessert offerings whether home or store-front baker.
The app will allow a registered user to create a recipe, edit and delete the recipe- with the premise that feedback given was not positive otherwise to be left for others to try. The ratings are from any user and if not to the creator liking they can then delete the rating and or recipe to which was rated poorly.
